The annual Computer Engineering department days by the **Institute of Computer Engineers of the Philippines Student Edition - USTP** was recently concluded, and this year's theme was "Enter the world of endless possibilities, Enter the world of the Matrix," inspired by the hit movie franchise, "The Matrix." This event is extra-special because it marks the return of face-to-face programs held by the organization. Students and faculty members had an unforgettable experience as they were transported into a world of mind-bending challenges and intense competition.

The event kicked off with an opening ceremony that featured a spectacular light and sound show, participants all donned their blue departmental CPE T-shirts. Students from different year levels graced the events with their cheers and performances. The **Photography and Poster-making contests** also commenced on this day. Photography contest participants were challenged to take pictures that capture the essence of the camaraderie of CpE students (and faculty) at their best in the CPE days programs. And also, poster-making participants are encouraged to draw a concept that addresses contemporary technological issues, reveals community issues, and raises awareness of a problem in a visually appealing, inclusive, and enjoyable manner.

The first day of the CPE Days is when the participants were faced with a series of mental challenges that required critical thinking and problem-solving skills. One of the most exciting challenges was the **"Intelligence Injection"**, a quiz bowl competition where teams had to decipher a series of complex Computer Engineering related questions and had to solve equations in a race against time. Other groups also competed in **"Resurrecting Circuits through Breadboarding"** where they were tasked to design and analyze combinatorial circuits and demonstrate how to build the smallest circuit required to implement a specific function. There is also an open programming competition branded **"Code Quests"** where individuals of prolific competence in programming compete on figuring out the code to solve their assigned machine problems. Lastly, the intense **"Enter the Matrix: An eSports Tournament"** commenced on this day. Players from different year levels clashed with their avatars in an arena where strategic thinking, teamwork, communication, leadership, and confidence are required.

On the second day, the court was filled with various physical challenges with the commencement of **"CpE Cup: Enter the Arena"** where participants were tested by their strength, agility, and endurance. The challenges include Men's Basketball, Mixed Volleyball, and Mixed Badminton Tournaments. The teams competed fiercely, each one determined to win and earn points for their respective team. There is also a Blitz Chess competition for enthusiasts. Of course, for those who love physical and mental activities, the **"Matrix Mayhem"**, an amazing race, offered both excitements to the racers. They are challenged to outwit and outrace each other across a predetermined route, stopping at numerous checkpoints of different CpE-related challenges with the ultimate goal of reaching the finish line in the shortest net time. Overall, it was an intense and exciting day.

The final day of the CPE Days was the most anticipated, as it featured **"The Chosen One: Search for Mr. and Ms. CPE with Talent Extravaganza"** where candidates, or agents as we call them here, competed in a pageant of poise, intelligence, and leadership. The agents were stunning as they flaunt their outfits in the casual CpE shirt category, school uniform category, and dapper career attire category. In the final category, they donned black leather and sunglasses, reminiscent of the iconic characters from the movie theme. There is also a showcase of talents from different year levels. They made the spectators awed by their talents and mesmerize by the wonders of their performances. An awarding ceremony followed the main events. Here, the winners from the last two days’ competitions were rewarded and given recognition, complete with medals, tokens, and a huge round of applause.

Overall, **RELOADED: CPE DAYS 2023** was a huge success, providing a unique and unforgettable experience for everyone involved.
